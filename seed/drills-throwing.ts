Place 4 cones in a straight line extending out from the throwing line at exactly 15 feet (1 point), 25 feet (2 points), 35 feet (3 points), and 45 feet (5 points — the 'rocket' cone). Kids line up single-file behind the throwing line. If you have a second coach, station them downfield past the 45-foot cone to retrieve balls and keep the game moving fast.",
    how_to_explain_to_kids: "Okay guys, we're going to see who has the strongest rocket arm! You're going to throw the ball as far as you can toward those cones. The first cone is worth 1 point, the second is 2 points, the third is 3 points, and if you can hit that LAST cone way out there — that's 5 points! Ready to launch some rockets?",

Set a starting cone at 10 feet from the bucket — this is the first throwing line. Place a second cone at 20 feet as the challenge line. Kids line up single-file behind the 10-foot cone.

We're going to kneel down on one knee and throw — and when you take your legs out of it, ALL the power goes to your arm. It's like an arm workout! Show me your throwing arm muscle.

See how I jumped toward you a little before I threw? That hop-step is what gives the ball all its power — like a running start for your arm. You're like a kangaroo that also plays baseball.

Fix: Freeze them mid-motion and look at their feet. 'Where is the step? The hop does not count without the step.' Break it into two separate pieces: hop, pause, then step and throw.",
      "Kids will rush all the footwork and just throw from wherever their feet happen to end up. Fix: Slow the entire drill to half speed and say 'We are going in slo-mo' out loud. Demonstrate in exaggerated slow motion yourself. Silly slow motion is fun for 4-year-olds and fixes mechanics faster than verbal correction."
